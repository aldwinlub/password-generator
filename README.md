# password-generator

## An Overview

In this assignment, we were given preexisting code where the html and css were already created. It structured a website where users can generate a random password upon user input. What I managed to accomplish through JavaScript was being able to prompt the user to input a value to choose how long they wanted their password to be and to choose what kind of characters they wanted to include as well. This was accomplished through various arrays and strings, if and if else statements, a for loop, creating functions, and finally calling those functions. I tried my best to comment on what or why certain code was included.
